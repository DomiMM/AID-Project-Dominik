In order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of drug discovery, attempts are now being made to work with machine learning algorithms. 

In this paper, the goal is to show whether a Random Forest Model can be used to predict, if a substance is suitable as an Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor or not.

For this purpose, the database Chembl has been used, the development environment Google Colab and the programming language Python.
